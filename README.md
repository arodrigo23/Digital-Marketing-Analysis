## Recommendations
* Consider reallocating the budget from underperforming ads, such as Facebook, to those with higher returns, mainly YouTube.
* Investigate the reasons for Facebook's negative return throughout the month.
* Explore ways to improve engagement for the mid- to low-CTR sources, especially the media banner ad.
